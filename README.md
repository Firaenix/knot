# Knot

## A bittorrent inspired, highly modular p2p data transfer system.

## Notable Changes

- Metainfo pieces list is actually a list, not a concatenated hex string, because we can select specific hashing algorithms to calculate the piece hashes.

### To Do:

- [ ] WebRTC

- [ ] TCP

- [ ] HTTP

- [ ] Browser compatibility

- [ ] Node JS Server

- [ ] New Metainfo Spec

- [ ] Bittorrent Tracker and DHT compatibility

- [ ] Signatures in Metainfo

- [ ] Merkel Tree for file pieces hash
